            Hi! My name is Arjun Arora and I am a junior in the College of Engineering, studying Computer Science. SI 339 has been a great introduction to front-end development and I have learnt a lot from this class thus far :)
            Although I was born in Seattle and lived there for the first ten years of my life, I associate most of my formative years with the time I spent after that, which was in
            <button id = "KolkataText" onclick="kolkataClick()">
                Kolkata, India
            </button>
            . A great part of Indian culture is their undying love for the sport of Cricket - unsurprisingly my favorite sport as well! 
            <br>
            <br>
            In this website, I will give my audience a brief introduction to the beautiful sport, along with the knowledge necessary to know all that is needed to have a fruitful conversation with an avid cricket fan, such as myself.
