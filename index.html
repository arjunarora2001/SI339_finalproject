                <h2>Yuvraj Singh</h2>
                <p>Yuvraj Singh, born on December 12th, 1981 is one the best all-rounders India has seen, popular for his spinning abilities in the bowling innings, and destructive six-hitting potential in the batting innings. The lore of Yuvraj Singh, however, extends beyond his genius on the field. Diagnosed with cancer in 2011, his grit and ability to never give in defined his image. Not only would he defeat his illness, he would, in 2011 itself, play a key role in India's World Cup triumph, taking home the Player of the Tournament award. An inspiration to many, he more than left his mark on all of the 1.4 billion Indians' hearts that watched him play, and has cemented his legacy in Indian cricket for eternity. Yuvi Paaji, as he is called by many, is remembered most perhaps for his iconic "Six Sixes" against England in 2007, when he became the first player ever to hit six sixes of all six balls of an over, that to against one of the most feared bowlers at the time: Stuart Broad. Motivated by an altercation with one of the other England players, he reminded the world what happens when you mess with India and when you mess with Yuvraj Singh. </p>

                <h2>Sir Don Bradman</h2>
                <p>Donald George Bradman predates any cricketer from the modern age. 
                    "The Don," as he is famously called, never played any ICC-regulated cricket. 
                    From world cups to franchise cricket, every tournament that is part of the foundation of the sport today came after Sir Don. 
                    Yet, they say there will never be anyone like him ever again. The holder of one of the most ridiculous record in all of sports, 
                    this behemoth of the game boasts a batting average of 99.94. Although records are meant to be broken, 
                    it is safe to say that this one will stand the test of time because it is simply unbeatable. 
                    He famously got out for 0 when he needed only four runs in his last ever game from Australia to achieve an average of 100. 
                    Nevertheless, his commitment to excellence and entertainment will never be forgotten and his place within the 
                    highest echelons of the game will never be questioned.</p>

                <h2>Shane Warne</h2>
                <p>On 4th March, 2022, the world mourned the loss of one Shane Warne. 
                    There aren't many cricketers one would put above Shane Warne when listing out the all time greats, 
                    and in an era where leg spin was starting to fade out of the game, the ultimate Aussie brought it back in a way only he could: 
                    with perfect precision. During his peak in the late 90s, Warne would lift the World Cup as vice-captain of Australia, 
                    putting in man of the match performances in the semis and the finals as well as ending the tournament as the highest wicket taker.
                    His rivalry with Sachin Tendulkar is part of cricket folklore and their battles will not be forgotten for. 
                    A fierce competitor, with an even stronger character, the world will not only Shane Warne the player, 
                    but Warney too, the bloke from Victoria. </p>

                <p>Alastair Cook is a blast from the past. A traditional opener in every sense of the word, he was notoriously difficult to dismiss for even the best in the world. 
                    The fifth highest run scorer in test history and England's highest capped test player, he was a specialist who seemed to, at times, 
                    be playing at a level far higher than that of his colleagues. He further enhanced his reputation as one of the most successful captains of all time, 
                    captaining the England test side more than any other player before or since. Although his major achievements did come in test cricket, 
                    you'd be a fool to underestimate his quality. Sir Alastair Cook might very well be one of the most underrated cricketers out there, 
                    and one can only hope history does him justice.</p>

                <h2>Ben Stokes</h2>
                <p>Born in New Zealand, made in England, Ben Stokes is one of the best players in the world today. Unlike others on that particular list, 
                    he is the only one who boasts expert skills in bowling, batting and fielding. An all-rounder of the highest quality, 
                    his comeback story is one of the greatest in the modern game. In 2016, he conceded 24 runs in 4 balls in the last over of the 
                    T20 World Cup finals as the West Indies snatched the trophy from the arms of the English. A year later, in a tour against the West Indies, 
                    Stokes would get involved in a bar brawl and be found guilty. He'd lose his biggest sponsorships and be temporarily suspended. 
                    But such is the grit and determination of Stokes, he would come back in spectacular fashion. He'd be the standout player in England's 2019 ODI 
                    and 2021 T20 World Cup wins and today, England are the kings of the cricketing world and Ben Stokes is all the way at the top. 
                    Nevertheless, his greatest moment ever is hitting the winning runs in one of the greatest Ashes matches ever. 
                    They say he could have batted for five more days and not gotten out. Sit back and enjoy this masterclass.</p>

                    from retirement, Shakib Al Hasan has found a way to stay at the top of the game and keep Bangladesh competitive for over a decade and a half. 
                    Bangladesh, who for the past few years have oscillated between being a minnow and a top dog, would not have achieved the heights they have without
                     their captain and main man. Over the years, he has proven his worth with the bat and ball, earning the status of one of the best all-rounders in

                     he also holds the very impressive record of being the first and only player to be the no.1 ranked all-rounder in all three formats of the game.

                    To date, the bowler with the highest international wickets of all time, his lore. 
                    Muralitharan was a key cog in a Sri Lankan team looking to finally establish themselves as a team that can compete at the very top. 
                    Besides being part of Sri Lanka's only ever World Cup win in 1996, he put the team on the map, at many times carrying them 
                    single-handedly through games. His list of records is enviable and the respect he garners within the game is unrivaled. 
                    He is simply one of the greatest to ever do it.</p>

                <h2>The Golden Era</h2>
                <p>If the Sri Lankan's of the 90s were the pioneers, the Sri Lankans of the late 2000s and the early 2010s were the golden era. 
                    A team of 11 world class athletes, it is almost impossible to pick one standout player. Each individual brought their own unique style as 
                    this team not only broke the Pakistan-India duopoly in Asia, but also conquered the world. From 2004 to 2014, this team won three Asia Cups 
                    and a T20 World Cup. During that time, they would also finish as runners up at a further two T20 World Cups and at 2 ODI World Cups. 
                    Although some might argue this team underachieved, the fear they struck into the hearts of their opponents cannot be understated. 
                    From Dilshan's “Pallu Scoop” to Malinga's “Slinga”, they displayed flair and quality in equal amounts. Sangakkara, Jayawardane and the 
                    evergreen Muralitharan brought experience, longevity and leadership in a way that few have in the history of the sport. Perera and Mathews 
                    could do it all in the middle too. The golden era of Sri Lankan cricket may never be replicated, but we can rest easy in the knowledge 
                    that they will never be forgotten.</p>

                    is well-respected and, as the cliché goes with New Zealand players, he went about his business without much fuss. Along with being one of the 
                    longest standing captains of the Kiwis, he became the first cricketer to play 100 games in all three formats of the game. As well-rounded 
                    as they come, his ability to adapt his game to the situation and make himself a valuable member of any team until the very end of his career 
                    is often overlooked by the mainstream media. Although he will most probably lose the mantle of highest run-scorer for New Zealand to the next 
                    player on our list, his contribution to the national team will be fondly remembered.</p>

                    he is the first captain to ever win a major ICC honor for New Zealand. Perennial underdogs at virtually every tournament they've played in, 
                    New Zealand made a habit of wowing audiences before eventually, always falling short. Under the calm and composed leadership of Williamson, 
                    however, they lifted the inaugural World Test Championship in 2021 against the no.1 ranked test team in the world: India. Part of the infamous, 
                    “Fab 4”, a term used to refer to the four best and most consistent batsmen in the game today, Williamson might not be the flashiest player, 
                    but he is by far one of the most respected.</p>

                <p>When the first ever cricket World Cup was organized, West Indies were the stars. It felt only right then, that half a century later,

                    If Sir Vivian is an embodiment of a cricketing era gone by, Chris Gayle is the embodiment of the modern game. A serial entertainer, 
                    he took to the T20 format like a fish to water. He had the build of an athlete and the charisma of a pop-star — in other words, he was the 
                    perfect poster boy for this new, exciting form of the game. But above all, Gayle was known for his power-hitting. 
                    A bowler's worst nightmare was facing an inform Chris Gayle and when the weather forecast predicted a “Gayle Storm,” 
                    even the greatest would run for cover. One of the only men to score a double-century in an ODI and a two times T20 World Cup winner, 
                    Chris Gayle's most iconic knock came in the IPL, where some might say he truly garnered his reputation. In what is undoubtedly the 
                    greatest Gayle Storm of all time, watch as the boy from Jamaica smashed an unbeaten 175 runs — another record we truly believe will never

                    earning him the tag of “Mr. 360°.” From being a top class finisher to a first rate fielder, he was also no slouch behind the wickets, performing 
                    the role of wicket-keeper on multiple occasions for South Africa and in franchise cricket. He holds the record for the fastest ever ODI century, 
                    which came in just 31 balls. He famously joined forces with Virat Kohli and Chris Gayle, the two other standout players of the T20 format in his 
                    generation, as they teamed up to represent the Royal Challengers Bangalore. Although they never won a major honor as a team, they left the

                <h2>Shahid Afridi</h2>
                <p>Shahid Afridi burst onto the scene like few. In his second ever international game in 1996, he broke the record for the fastest ever ODI century
                     at the time, scoring his ton in 37 balls and establishing his prowess as a lights out power hitter. This is a tag he would never lose until the 
                     very end of his playing days to the extent that as long as Afridi was still playing, there was always hope. Following the 1992 World Cup winning
                      team was always going to be an uphill task, and at times Afridi would, with his skillful bowling and expert batting, put the team on his back 
                      and more often than not, lead them to victory. One of the most memorable captains of the Pakistan national team, Afridi's impact on the sport 
                      in his home country is unlikely to be forgotten.</p>

                <h2>Wasim Akram</h2>
                <p>Pakistan have always had a reputation of nurturing deadly fast bowlers, but that reputation didn't come from nowhere. It came from Wasim Akram. 
                    Considered one of the greatest fast bowlers of all time, he was the first bowler to reach 500 wickets in ODIs. A World Cup winner and ICC Hall 
                    of Famer, he very impressively recorded over four hat-tricks in international cricket, only one of two players to do so. During the aforementioned
                     World Cup in 1992, Akram would take more wickets than any other bowler and guide Pakistan to their only ever ODI World Cup win. 
                     He remained at the top of the game for almost his entire career and famously had a great rivalry with Sachin Tendulkar, the standout batsmen 
                     from Pakistan's historical rivals: India. </p>
